They work by generating a token that is associated with a URL or form, which is then verified when returned to the server.\r\n\r\n## CsrfGenerateToken()\r\n\r\nFunction to generate a CSRF token, automatically storing it within the session (Currently as a key/token combination under session._csrfTokens).\r\n\r\n### Arguments\r\n\r\n* key (string, optional, defaults \"\") - Used to uniquely identify a token.  This is useful if you have a requirement to use CSRF tokens in several places, as each can be provided a unique token without interfering with each other.\r\n* random (boolean, optional, defaults false) - False will only generate a fresh token on the first request (against the \"key\" argument), subsequent requests for a token will return the same token (until the session expires).  True will generate a fresh token for the key provided, each time the function is called, overwriting the previously generated token.\r\n\r\n## CsrfVerifyToken()\r\n\r\nThis provides the functionality to verify tokens that have previously been generated.\r\n\r\n### Arguments\r\n\r\n* token (string, required) - The token that you wish to verify.\r\n* key (string, optional, defaults \"\") - Key which identifies the token you're trying to verify.  This must be the same as the one that you called CsrfGenerateToken with.","tagline":"Extension to provide CSRF functions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
